The course consists of 3.5 hours of video lectures and a 380-page lab guide that contains exercises and challenges for you to practice your skills in a virtual lab environment. You will need two compatible wireless cards to perform the exercises. The recommended cards are Netgear WN111v2 USB and ALFA Networks AWUS036H USB 500mW[^4^]. You will also need a computer with BackTrack Linux installed, which is a penetration testing distribution that contains all the tools you will need for the course.
 
## What is OSWP?
 
OSWP is a certification that validates your ability to audit and secure wireless devices. To earn the OSWP certification, you need to pass a practical exam that requires you to perform a series of attacks against four different wireless networks within a four-hour time limit. The exam is conducted remotely using a proctored virtual lab environment. You will need to submit a comprehensive penetration test report that documents your findings and methodology. The report should be written in PDF format and should not exceed 42 pages[^1^]. You will receive your exam results within 10 business days after submitting your report.
 
## How to prepare for the exam?
 
The best way to prepare for the exam is to follow the WiFu course materials and practice your skills in the lab environment. You should be able to perform all the attacks covered in the course without referring to the lab guide or the videos. You should also review the wireless networking theory and terminology, as well as the Aircrack-ng suite commands and options. You should familiarize yourself with the exam objectives and format, and plan your time management accordingly. You should also practice writing clear and concise penetration test reports that follow the report template provided by Offensive Security.
